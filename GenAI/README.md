A data loader helps you prepare and load data. Frameworks such as PyTorch have a dedicated data loader class.

Data loaders enable:
1. efficient batching and shuffling of data which is essential for training neural networks.
2. They allow for on-the-fly pre-processing (optimizes memory usage by loading only the required data during training)
3. integrate with the PyTorch training pipeline
4. Simplifies data augmentation
